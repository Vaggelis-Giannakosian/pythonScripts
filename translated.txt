Returns today strongly to the fore the timeless question of people management, optimum utilization of people, that is the most important intangible asset of any organization or company. It has been observed that the rapid development of new technologies in recent decades has affected so few managers that become trapped in the perception that their success is based on material property data. With this perception came to perceive as "given" every intangible asset of the company (people, culture, customer relations, etc.). The fact they have been denied.

More "dangerous" one might characterize the fact that most managers, if asked, characterize their customer-oriented company and therefore anthropocentric. Unfortunately, in most cases, do not realize that people's issues are no longer just the responsibility of the human resources management department, but every department responsible targeted. If this were true, then they will greatly limit the circumstances in which, in front of a finding that sales do not touch the predetermined objectives, managers are driven to the last resort of workers' dismissal. One certainly does not deny the fact that in the modern knowledge-based economy, the pressures that businesses exist to adapt, change and flexibility is enormous. Just need top managers realize that the solution of job cuts can only bring temporary benefit to the financial statement.
